# Overview
This project explores how car speeds relate to their color based on observational data collected by three observers: Reda, Nisrine, and Zain. It highlights patterns, potential observer bias, and interesting speed trends over time.

# Observations by Reda

Silver, white, and red cars appeared across a wide range of speeds (low to high).
Black and blue cars mostly stayed within moderate speeds (25–35 mph).
Yellow cars were rare but often recorded at high speeds.
The most common speed range for all colors was 25–35 mph, likely reflecting school zone regulations.
Suggests color may slightly correlate with driving behavior.

# Observations by Nisrine

- Analyzed data from eight car colors: black, blue, brown, gray, red, silver, white, yellow.
- **Highest observed speeds**:
  - Silver (≈43 mph) and red cars observed at highest speeds.
  - Reda also noted fast speeds for blue/red cars but inconsistently.
  - Zain noted high speeds for white (≈40 mph) and red cars.
- **Lowest observed speeds**:
  - Reda: brown (≈23 mph), yellow (≈24 mph)
  - Zain: similar low colors, but not as low.
  - Nisrine showed slightly higher consistency for these slower colors.

> The variation may reflect **vantage points** or **personal observation styles**.

# Observations by Zain

- Chart shows how speeds changed over time.
- **Trends identified**:
  - Gradual increase in average speeds over days.
  - Spikes on specific dates (due to lower traffic or anomalies).
  - Most cars remained between 25–35 mph.
  - Timing (time of day or day of week) may influence speeds.

# Conclusion

This project revealed:

- **Color and speed have possible correlations**, especially with silver, red, and yellow cars.
- **Observer bias and perspective** may affect data significantly.
- **Speeds generally increased slightly** over the observation period.

 Consistent data collection and awareness of observer influence are essential in observational studies.
